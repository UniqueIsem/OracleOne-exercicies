- SECRET FRIEND
On the folder "secret-friend" you will se a website that implements java script logic. The program has a friendly UI in which the user has to input friend's names and add them into a green list showed on the screen after pressing the "add friend" button. After all names are set (the user decides how many names will add) there's an orange button on the bottom of the screen, this trigger a js function that reveals a big orange message on the screen with the name of the secret friend, wich is picked randomly by the program. 
  - if the user set an empty field the program will show an error message.
  - if the user click the orange button before adding a friend, the program will show an error message.
  - if the user repeats the name of a friend already added into the list, the program will show an error message.
  - The error messages, green list and orange message appear and disapear depending on the state of the program to get a better UI.
